Process Scheduler
========

Process Scheduler is a program that schedules and visualizes theoritical processes made by the user or generated by the computer. 
Each process has a priority (1-8, lowest being higher) which is handled using the **[Round-robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling)** algorithm.

**1.** Graphical display of processes.    
**2.** Desired time quantum.    
**3.** Number of processes to generate.    
**4.** Generate button randomly generates processes with random start times, burst times, and priorities.    
**5.** List of processes. Choosing one highlights it in the graphical display.    
**6.** Manual process creator.    
**7.** Curent process queue.    
**8.** Clear process list.    
**9.** Delete selected process.    
**10.** Next step in the timeline.    
**11.** Go to start of the timeline

Usage
--------
Generate some processes from the generate button (make sure to set your desired maximum process number) or 
create custom processes from Edit > Process wizard. Delete undesired processes by selecting them and hitting the
Delete button. Once your processes are ready, set your desired time quantum. You can now click the forward button
(labeled no. 10 above) to go forward one step, or click it once and hold down the enter key to fast-forward.
Notice how some processes are scheduled for later if a higher priority process comes up in the queue. Finished
parts of a process are drawn in dark green color.
